# DE_Pipeline_Project
A complete end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline built using Python, PySpark, and MongoDB. This project simulates a real-world food delivery platform (Swiggy/Zomato style), generates synthetic order data using Python, processes and enriches the data using PySpark, and stores both detailed records and aggregated analytics inside MongoDB.
